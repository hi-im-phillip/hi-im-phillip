## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Filip and I'm always interested in new techologies.  ðŸ¤–

Master's degree in Information Technology Engineering and began my journey in 2017 as a systems engineer within the Cisco ecosystem.

In late 2019, I transitioned to backend development. As a Backend Developer with 4 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building high-performing systems using technologies like Java, Spring, Docker, Kubernetes.
I am a Spring Certified Professional (2024) and am committed to continuous learning. In my free time, Iâ€™m passionate about self-hosting applications to experiment with various software stacks and cloud infrastructure. This hobby helps me stay current with emerging technologies and sharpen my skills outside of work.

While Iâ€™m dedicated to my current role, Iâ€™m always curious about exploring new ideas and opportunities to broaden my skills. Whether itâ€™s adopting new technologies, diving deeper into cloud infrastructure, or contributing to innovative projects, Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and professional growth. ðŸ¦¾
